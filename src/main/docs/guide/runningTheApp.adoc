Now, if we run our app, we can try out the RESTful API that Grails has generated for us. Start up the app using a local installation of Grails 3.2.4 or one of the provided wrappers: `./gradlew bootRun` or `./grailsw run-app`

[source,bash]
----
$ ./grailsw run-app
----

Now we can exercise the API using cURL or another API tool.

Make a `GET` request to `/vehicle` to get a list of Vehicles:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -X "GET" "http://localhost:8080/vehicle"

Make a `GET` request to `/driver/1` to get a particular Driver instance:

[source,bash]

$ curl -X "PUT" "http://localhost:8080/vehicle/1" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
