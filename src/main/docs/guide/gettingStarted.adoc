In this guide you are going to create Grails app using React as a view layer. You will be using the 1.0.2 version of the React profile (single project, using Webpack and the Asset Pipeline).

A few changes were made to the initial project (compared to a default Grails project using the 1.0.2 version of the React profile). A patch file containing the changes is provided in the https://github.com/grails-guides/building-a-react-app/blob/master/initial.patch[guide repo].
